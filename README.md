# Bad Apple!!
Bad Apple!! is considered by some as the "graphical version of 'hello world'". It's a challenge to use platforms not meant for dispaying computer graphics to play the MV Bad Apple!!

This repository is a collection of all the Bad Apple!! projects I've made. There are 2 files used for setting up projects
- `new.py` used for setting up a new template folder (run `py new.py -h` for more info)
- `toframe.py` used for creating a folder of individual frames of the Bad Apple!! video (totally not because I can never remember how to use ffmpeg)

## General process for running
1. In this directory, run
    ```
    py toframe.py
    ```
    This will create a folder of frames based on the `config.json` of each directory

2. Then, follow the instructions in each directory (if there are any), or just read the code and try to figure it out ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
3. There is no step 3, why did I even bother writing all of this
