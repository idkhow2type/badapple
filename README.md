# Bad Apple!!
Bad Apple!! is considered by some as the "graphical version of 'hello world'". It's a challenge to use platforms not meant for dispaying computer graphics to play the MV Bad Apple!!

Bad Apple!! is quite a special video, as it (mostly) contains only 2 colors and also very recognizable at really low resolutions. This makes it very easy to stream on many different platforms

This repository is a collection of all the Bad Apple!! projects I've made. There are 2 files used for setting up projects
- `new.py` used for setting up a new template folder (run `py new.py -h` for more info)
- `toframe.py` used for creating a folder of individual frames of the Bad Apple!! video (totally not because I can never remember how to use ffmpeg)
